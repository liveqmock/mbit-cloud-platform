{groovy-www}[Groovy] is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine. It builds upon the strengths of Java, but has additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk.

Groovy makes modern programming features available to Java developers with almost-zero learning curve as well as supports Domain-Specific Languages and other compact syntax so your code becomes easy to read and maintain.

Groovy makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its powerful processing primitives, OO abilities and an Ant DSL.

It also increases developer productivity by reducing scaffolding code when developing web, GUI, database or console applications. Groovy simplifies testing by supporting unit testing and mocking out-of-the-box. Groovy also seamlessly integrates with all existing Java classes and libraries and compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you can use Java.

== Sources for the Groovy website

This project builds the Groovy website. It is using {gradle}[Gradle] and is fully statically generated.

Build is image:{build-icon}[build status, link={groovy-ci}].

== Generating the site

----
git clone https://github.com/groovy/groovy-website
cd groovy-website
./gradlew webzip
----

The output can be found in the `build` directory:

----
build
  |---- site            : the generated static website
  |---- reports         : deadlinks report
  |---- distributions   : zip of the website
----

== Contributing

The website is generated thanks to Gradle and makes use of the {markupte}[Markup Template Engine]. The structure of the
project consists of two modules:

----
generator                       : utility classes and model for generating the website
site                            : the website itself
----

The website subproject consists of:

----
src/main/site                   : sources for the static website
          |--- assets           : static resources such as images, CSS files, ...
          |--- html             : elements that templates include as raw HTML contents
          |--- includes         : includes used by templates
          |--- layouts          : layouts for the various pages
          |--- pages            : individual pages
build.gradle                    : website weaving logic
----

== Continuous Integration

The official CI server runs {groovy-ci}[here] (login as user guest and leave the password blank) and is sponsored by http://www.jetbrains.com[JetBrains].

WARNING: The website is continuously updated from the _master_ branch. This means that *every merge on master is immediately published*. Changes that need to be
applied on a specific date need to be done on a dedicated branch.
